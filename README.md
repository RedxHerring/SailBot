# 1 Intro
The UMass SailBot Team is a competitor in the annual IRSR "SailBot" Competition. Our goal is to build an autonomous sailboat, enter it into the competition and place. The team was started during the 2019 fall semester by @cobiebeef, a past competitor in SailBot.

# 2 Who We Are
UMass Sailbot is a Team of EE, Comp-E, ME, IE, and CS students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

# 3 SailBot
__History from the [SailBot website](https://www.sailbot.org)__
> The International Robotic Sailing Regatta (SailBot) is a robotic sailing competition held in North America in which teams of university,  college and high school students compete. The first event, in 2006, was hosted by Queenâ€™s University, at Kingston, Ontario and was inspired by the success of a senior project at the University of British Columbia to build a robotic sailboat. Since 2008 teams have annually competed throughout the US and Canada, with teams traveling from as far away as Europe and Brazil. The goal is to create an unmanned sailboat that navigates through a variety of challenges with limited, if any, human control. Students are able to use this friendly competition between schools to apply their engineering knowledge in a multi-disciplinary task that requires mechanical, electrical, software and engineering management skills to deal with this highly variable environment.

> The competition is oriented to boats competing in the SailBot Class (up to 2 meters in length) but smaller boats are popular due to their easier logistics. There is an Open Class (which are boats up to 4 meters in length) oriented toward non-school teams. Occasionally boats above two meters in length enter in preparation for the MicroTransAt Challenge (max 2.4 meters length) or the  World Robotics Sailing Championship (up to 4 meters in length). Many teams use the MaxiMOOP as their first platform due to its convenient size (1.2m), light weight (20 kg), much greater payload capability than an RC boat and improved seaworthiness.

# 5 What's Here
In this Git you will find the code that we made to drive our boat along with a fleshed out Wiki on every aspect of it (and a few misc. items). You should expect to find Arduino C++ code for our rapid prototyping phase of the project, some python code for simulation and machine vision, and some c code for the finial product. Also expect some of the graphic design and CAD that went along with the project.
